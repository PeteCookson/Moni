## User Stories - the outcome...
---
### In this development I wanted the new user to:
* Quickly understand the main purpose of the site.

* Navigate easily and identify relevant assets.

* Easily input data and return real time values of cryptocurrencies.

* To view a quick and simple visualisation of the value of current assets.

## Version Control
---
### Git & GitHub

I used **[GitPod](https://gitpod.io/)** as a local repository and IDE and **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** as a remote repository. The process of version control was:

* First i created a new repository on GitHub 
* I have then opened that repository on GitPod and started coding
* In GitPod i have created all the pages and and folders 
* I was then saving my work and pushing it to GitHub repository to keep it safe
* The process I used for checking, saving, commiting and pushing it to remote repository is:
    * `git status` for checking and displaying the state of the repository and staging area
   * `git add . `  for adding work to git
    * `git commit -m "Commit message" ` used for saving changes
    * `git push ` used to upload content to a Github
## Deployment
---
To deploy the website on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
1. Go to **"Settings"** in the repository
2. In **"Source"** of **"GitHub Pages"**, select **"master** for Branch and click save
3. The website is now published on GitHub Pages and the link is provided on on the same section
